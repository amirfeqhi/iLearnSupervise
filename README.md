## 1.Supervised-LinearRegression

This directory contains an implementation of linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a restaurant franchise, as part of the linear regression module in the course.

- Linear_Regression.ipynb: Jupyter notebook implementing linear regression on the restaurant dataset.

## 2.Supervised-LogisticRegression

This directory contains implementations of logistic regression applied to two different datasets, as part of the logistic regression module in the course.

- Logistic_Regression.ipynb: Jupyter notebook implementing logistic regression on the iris and social network datasets.

## About this Repository

This is part of my machine learning practicing journey. The implementations and notes here are based on the materials and assignments from the Coursera Specialization linked above.
